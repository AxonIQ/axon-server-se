# About this guide

This guide describes AxonServer concepts, setup and configuration. 
It does not discuss the CQRS and EventSourcing patterns, that are the basis for clients using the AxonServer.
For more insight about these, please check the AxonFramework documentation.

AxonServer has two main variants, a free version and an enterprise version. Some of the features discussed in this
guide are only available in the enterprise version.
